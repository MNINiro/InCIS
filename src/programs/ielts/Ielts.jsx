                            to help you work, study or migrate to a country where English is the
                            native language. This includes countries such as Australia, Canada,
                            New Zealand, the UK and USA. Your ability to listen, read, write and

                            a scale of 1-9. IELTS is jointly owned by the British Council, IDP: IELTS
                            Australia and Cambridge English.</p>
