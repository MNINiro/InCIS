                        <h2>What is IAL or International Advanced Level?</h2>
                        <p>An A-level is an Advanced level GCE qualification. This exam is divided into
                            two parts known as AS-Level and A2 Level. After the first year of study,
                            students take the AS-Level examination. At the end of year two, they normally
                            take A2 Level examination. Students can also take the A-Level all together at
                            the end of two years of studies. After you have taken your IGCSE or O-level
                            exams you can take any number of A-levels; and will often depend on the
                            qualifications that your chosen institution has asked for. In the UK, many
                            college students take three or four A-levels for their final two years of study.</p>

                        <h2>Who can take IAL exam?</h2>
                        <p>Anyone who has completed IGCSE or O-Level Examination under any board in the UK
                            can take A-Level for their higher studies. In Bangladesh, most of the schools
                            are following either the Edexcel examinations’ or the Cambridge examinations’.
                            In InCIS we are also following both of the syllabuses for our students.
                            Students can take tuition for both of the syllabi from us to sit for their
