                        <h2>What is IGCSE or O Level?</h2>
                        <p>GCE is one of the most internationally recognised qualifications.
                            You can take this qualification at the Ordinary (O)/IGCSE or the
                            Advanced (A) levels, depending on what you need it for and the
                            course you intend to follow.</p>

                        <p>The Ordinary level has been replaced by IGCSE (International General
                            Certificate of Secondary Education), it is available to international
                            students. We advise you to take a preparation course that specifically
                            follows a syllabus if you want to take either of these exams.</p>

                        <p>Anyone who has completed 10th grade can sit for IGCSE Examination.
                            In Bangladesh, most of the schools are following either the Pearson Edexcel

                            syllabus. In InCIS we are also following both of the syllabuses for our students.

                            and O-Level examination.</p>
