            <h2>What is Masters Program?</h2>
            <p>A Master’s degree is an academic qualification granted at the postgraduate
              level to individuals who have successfully undergone study demonstrating a
              high level of expertise in a specific field of study or area of professional
              practice. Students who graduate with a master’s degree should possess advanced
              knowledge of a specialized body of theoretical and applied topics, a high
              level of skills and techniques associated with their chosen subject area,
              and a range of transferable and professional skills gained through
              independent and highly focused learning and research.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="masters__duration">
            <h2>How long will it take to complete the masters?</h2>
            <p>Master’s degrees typically take one to three years to complete, through
              either part-time or full-time study. The specific duration varies depending
              on the subject, the country in which you study and the type of master’s
              degree you choose. In terms of study credits, the standardized European
              system of higher education specifies students must have 90-120 European
              Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) credits, while in the UK
              it takes 180 credits to complete a master’s program, and 36 to 54 semester
              credits in the US.</p>

            <p>A Masters degree at an American university usually takes around two years of 
              full-time study to complete (though some courses are shorter).</p>
            <p>This is longer than in some other countries (such as the UK) but reflects the 
              greater emphasis on structured training and regular assessment on a US graduate programme.</p>
            <p>In most cases, the greater length of your degree will be offset by the additional 
              development opportunities and transferable skills you acquire during it.</p>
            <p>Possession of an American Masters degree may also shorten the amount of time required 
              to achieve a PhD in the same field.</p>
            <p>Canadian Masters programmes usually last between one and two years (there might be 
              additional internships or placements).</p>
            <p>Several Canadian universities offer Masters programmes through the ‘co-operative 
              education option’.</p>
            <p>Co-op enables current students to gain hands-on, paid experience in placements 
              related to their field of study. These opportunities are available in all disciplines 
              and provide valuable work experience and contacts. Employers involved in the co-op 
              programme get highly qualified and motivated students to undertake specialised projects. 
              Many of them also use it as a recruitment tool, allowing them to really get to know 
              potential candidates and their abilities. For Masters students these internships are 
              usually between two and four months.</p>
            <p>The UK higher education system encompasses many different kinds of qualification at 
              Masters level, ranging from academic programmes to more practical, vocational 
              postgraduate courses. Most programmes require one year of full-time study (90 ECTS), 
              although research-based Masters are usually two years long.</p>
            <p>In the UK, academic Masters degrees involve advanced study of a subject that you 
              may have had experience of at undergraduate level, allowing you to specialise in a 
              certain topic within the discipline.</p>
            <p>They can be divided into two broad types: taught programmes, which are generally 
              more structured, and research Masters, which require a greater amount of independent research.</p>

            <h2>Best place to get your Masters degree</h2>
            <p>For the Masters’ program, the USA, Canada, England, and Australia
              are the most common destination for higher study abroad. Besides
              these countries, some European countries like Germany, the Netherlands,
              Finland, Sweden, and Switzerland are also an immensely popular choice
              for higher-level studies. These countries offer the best quality of
              education for the next generation. They have world-renowned universities
              to offer lots of courses under various departments.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="masters__apply">
            <h2>How to Apply for a Masters’ program</h2>

            <p>Applying process for a Masters’ degree program is different in these
              countries. All top-class universities have some common requirements
              besides their specific entry requirements.</p>

            <p>Applying to a US, UK and Canada Masters degree can be quite an extensive
              process. Universities want to make sure students end up on the right graduate
              programmes and therefore put a lot of time and effort into their admissions
              process. They expect you to do the same with your application.</p>

            <p>This doesn’t mean that it’s harder to get a place on a Masters degree in
              these countries. But you will need to provide more materials and more detail
              about your existing qualifications than you might be asked for elsewhere.</p>

            <p>Remember too that you will also need to secure a student visa alongside
              your university place.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="masters__requirements">
            <h2>entry requirements for master admission</h2>
            <p>Universities will require more from you than an undergraduate degree result. 
              You will be expected to have a minimum GPA often a 3.0/4.0 for your undergraduate degree.</p>
            <p>You will have to submit the following as part of your application:
              <ul>
                <li>A completed application form, which is often submitted online</li>
                <li>Academic cover letter</li>
                <li>Certified copies of your degree and academic transcripts</li>
                <li>Research proposal (if you’re applying for a research Masters like an MPhil or MRes)</li>
                <li>A curriculum vitae</li>
                <li>Proof of English and/or French proficiency, depending on the programme that you 
                  are applying for. If English is not your first language you may also be asked for 
                  a certain language test score.</li>
                <li>References / recommendation letters</li>
                <li>Letter of motivation / personal statement</li>
                <li>Proof that you meet financial requirements</li>
                <li>Evidence of your Overseas Student Health Cover (for Australia)</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>More selective graduate programmes often require scores from graduate admissions tests. 
              Some will ask to interview you if you are shortlisted.</p>
            <p>Academic programmes may also ask you to submit a specific research statement with your 
              application. This is particularly likely if you are applying to a graduate programme 
              with the opportunity to continue on to PhD work.</p>

          <div className="masters__europe">
            <h2>Masters in European countries</h2>
            <p>Most of the European universities’ entry requirements are very much similar to the 
              USA or UK. Sometimes universities ask for special proof of evidence.</p>
            <p>University application deadlines are very different from country to country. And 
              they sometimes depend on whether you need a student visa. To start studying in autumn, 
              applications might close as early as January (Sweden or Finland) up until as late as 
              July (Germany) or even August/September (Austria or Poland).</p>
          </div>

          <div className="masters__tests">
            <h2>what standardized tests are required</h2>
            <p>Graduate admissions tests are a more common requirement in the US, UK, Australia, 
              and the Canadian education system than they are in other countries. They allow your 
              university to assess general skills such as abstract reasoning, problem-solving and 
              critical thinking.</p>
            <p>A number of tests are in use, but the two most common are the Graduate Record 
              Examination (GRE) and the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT).</p>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>The general GRE test is not specific to any particular discipline (though some 
                  subject-specific variants are offered).</li>
                <li>The GMAT is generally associated with applications for MBA degrees at graduate 
                  business schools.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Your prospective university should be able to tell you which test it requires. some 
              programmes may accept either a GRE or a GMAT score. You should not need to sit both 
              unless you are applying to multiple institutions with preferences for different tests.</p>

          <div className="masters__fees">
            <h2>Masters fees and funding in the USA</h2>
            <p>As a rough guide, a Masters at a public university in America will charge tuition fees 
              of around $20,000-35,000 per year for international students. However, as you’d expect 
              from a country the size of America, there is a lot of variation between programmes and 
              institutions.</p>
            <p>It’s also important to remember that relatively few Masters students in America pay the 
              full cost of their course. Many receive funding from their university or from other 
              organisations.</p>

            <h2>Masters fees and funding in Canada</h2>
            <p>Tuition fees for international students in Canada are relatively affordable compared 
              to those in the UK and America, with most programmes costing somewhere between 
              CAD $13,000 and CAD $20,500 (USD $9,966-15,715). Arts and Humanities subjects will be 
              at the lower end of this scale, with Dentistry, Architecture and Business nearer the top. 
              Domestic Canadian students generally pay tuition fees at around half the rate paid by 
              foreign students.</p>

            <h2>Average Masters fees and funding in the UK</h2>
            <p>Tution fees varies from £15000 to £21000 in most of programmes. It is mainly depending 
              on the courses you will choose</p>

            <h2>Masters fees and funding in Australia</h2>
            <p>In Australia, postgraduate tuition fees are set by individual universities and not the 
              government, so you’ll find a wide range of costs across different institutions and courses.</p>
            <p>As a rough guide, programmes cost between AUD $22,000 and AUD $50,000 per year per 
              year (USD $15,100-34,305) for overseas students. Masters in the Arts and Humanities 
              will be at the lower end of this scale, while Science-based programmes will be towards 
              the top. Subjects like Veterinary Science and Medicine could be even higher.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="masters__europe-fees">
            <h2>Tuition fees for Non-EU citizens studying in the EU</h2>
            <p>European higher education institutions welcome non-EU students in Europe. Although 
              they are required to pay for tuition fees, international students can apply for 
              scholarships or funding almost everywhere. Europe has a total of over 16 billion 
              EUR worth of scholarships available every year.</p>
            <p>Tuition fees in Europe can vary significantly, but they are generally lower when 
              compared to North America and Australia. That does not mean that the quality of 
              education is also lower. Many European universities are listed as some of the best 
              in the world in top rankings.</p>
            <p>Tuition fees in Europe range between:
              <ul>
                <li>0 – 42,500 EUR/academic year for Bachelor’s degrees</li>
                <li>0 – 56,000 EUR/academic year for Master’s degrees</li>
              </ul>              
            </p>
            <p>You can find Bachelor’s and Master’s programmes with higher tuition fees, but they 
              are few and far between and are usually offered by private universities in disciplines 
              like Business and Management or Medicine.</p>
