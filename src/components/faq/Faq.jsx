                                Yes, these universities do offer a wide range of Aid, Scholarships for international students
                                but are very competitive. We recommend applying for need-based financial aid to these institutions
                                instead. InCIS counselors can help you in this regard.

                                (if available) or rent a residence off-campus.

                                The Australian year, however, starts in February with a few admissions in July
                                also. The European countries application deadlines vary significantly.

                                as international students have a higher chance of admission. We recommend starting on the

                                Yes. Most of the universities do require an advance deposit from you once you have accepted their
                                offer of admission as a means of confirmation and assurance.
